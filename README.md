# tesseractr

This script exists because I've found multiple use cases to quickly grab a screenshot and turn it into text.
The current form works well to grab a participant list from an outlook meeting and get it converted to text



Create an Automator project, add shell script and insert the code.
The script requires tesseract and iconv installed
The current code includes a selection of danish as that fits my use case, but can be changed according to your needs
